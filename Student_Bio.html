<p> My name is Keiichi Tsuchya. I hail from the mountains of Japan. During my younger years I delivered tofu for my father's tofu shop. Once I was able to drive I would deliver tofu by driving my father's 1986 Toyota Hachiroku. </p>

<p>The Hachiroku was to me a tool and I did not care for driving it. However, I would be smacked by my dad if I spilled the water in the tofu cups so I had to make sure I drove smooth and carefully. Did I tell you I drove through the mountains for deliveries? Anyways, eventually I became so good that I ended up being named as the king of the mountains. I found a way to drive through the mountains while not only being fast, but by also allowing the back end of the car to gracefully slide around the corners of the mountains. This eventually became what is known today as "Drifting". I am known known around the world as "D.K." or "Drift King". </p>
